## About

The Colouring Cities Research Programme (CCRP) supports the UN Sustainable Development Goals by advancing social, economic, and environmental progress through academic research.

We are a global, multidisciplinary network of researchers co-developing open data platforms to improve knowledge sharing on the built and natural environment.

Our focus is on pooling academic resources to enhance impact, co-designing tools and platforms, exploring AI/ML applications, and promoting ethical, collaborative, non-competitive research.
